# FlowSolve

flow-solve is a solver for flow levels  
this project consist of code considered lethal, read at your own risk  

## build

build in your favourite ide

## speed

highly depends on number of flows  
fewer flows take longer because the paths are longer

level size | max time
---------- | ----
2 - 8      | milliseconds
9 - 10     | seconds
11-12      | minutes
13         | hours
14         | years
15+        | universes
